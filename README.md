# Flappy Bird 🐦

Welcome to the Flappy Bird Clone project! This is a simple, fun, and addictive game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game. This project was created using Pygame and includes an AI neural network that plays the game through the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm.

## Features 📋
- Simple and intuitive controls
- Engaging and addictive gameplay
- Score tracking
- Clean and minimalist design
- Sound effects and background music

## How to Play 🎮
- Start the Game: Run the game by executing the main Python script (flappybird.py).
- Control the Bird: Click the mouse to make the bird flap its wings and fly.
- Avoid Obstacles: Navigate the bird to avoid hitting the pipes and the ground.
- Score Points: Your score increases with each pipe you successfully pass through.
- Game Over: The game ends if the bird hits a pipe or the ground. Try to beat your high score!

## AI 🤖
- Open the config-feedforward.txt file in the NEAT folder.
- Modify the configuration settings to customize the inputs, hidden layers, and other neural network parameters as needed.
- Run the ai_bird.py script. 

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library
- NEAT-Python library
